    "### Strengths:\n",

    "2. **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time data is processed to understand current traffic conditions. Algorithms analyze this data to predict travel times and suggest faster routes if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geocoding**: When a user inputs an address or landmark, algorithms convert this textual location description into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). This process is known as geocoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Route Optimization with Multiple Stops**: If a user has multiple places to visit, algorithms can determine the most efficient route to take to visit all points with the least distance or time. This involves solving a variant of the Traveling Salesperson Problem.\n",
